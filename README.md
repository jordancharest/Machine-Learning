After learning the intuition behind several machine learning models and implementing them using python libraries scikit-learn and keras,
I wanted to get a deeper understanding of the math behind the models. This repo represents that effort. It follows Andrew Ng's Machine
Learning Course on Coursera. I use MatLab's built-in computational capabilities to quickly develop the algorithms behind the machine learning models I
previously learned.
